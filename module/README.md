# Modules

The modules in here will contain most of the code. Module can include:

* Angular code, usually packages as a NgModules
* Angular widgets (visual gadgets), or services
* Plain TS/JS code - usable across client and server

In this example repo, all the modules are sitting right here in the
monorepo. It is also possible for some to reside in other repos.
